# ProjectOne
### # 

### First project in FinTech bootcamp.

## Objective

Use Python with various modules, libraries, and APIs to aggregate and analyze crypto and stock performance data from 2022 into 2023 to determine whether or not it's a good time for our client to add crypto to their portfolio.

## Methods

- Technical Analysis
- Risk Classification
- Sentiment Analysis

---

## Summary

We begin by analyzing the historical performance data from 2022 into 2023 pulled using the [Historic_Crypto API](https://pypi.org/project/Historic-Crypto/). Next, we simulate a portfolio investing $10k at the beginning of 2023 to verify performance. After we have a sense of market performance, the portfolio is assigned a risk profile that can be checked against our client's risk tolerance. Finally, we analyze current market sentiment and gauge confidence levels for the crypto and stock markets.

Moving forward, we would expand with ML, AI, and additional analyses to bring it up to speed with today's advancements.

## Performance & Mock Porfolio Analysis

### Key Takeaways
- All 4 securities had 2022 losses
- S&P 500 lost the least: 25%
- ADA lost the most: 84%
- BTC has the largest 2023 gain
- Initial Investment: $10,000
- Final Price: $12,072
- Gain/Loss: +$2,072
- All 4 securities have 2023 gains

### Analysis
All of the four securities had losses in 2022. The crypto losses were more compared to the S&P 500, which is to be expected due to the volatility of the crypto market in general. Bitcoin fell to a three-year low of $15,760
falling %31,694 or 66.8%. Being the most significant market mover, Bitcoin's fall surely caused the major falls seen for other tokens as well. Ethereum dropped 74% and ADA dropped a whopping 84%!

All of the four securites had gains in 2023. Bitcoin has seen a 30% bounce, the largest of the bunch during the month of January with the others moving slightly behind, but also with upward trajectories. Ethereum and Cardano both saw jumps of 27% and the S&P 500 has gained 9%. These upward moves have stopped the downward slope of a bearish market into what looks to be a possible breakout and reversal into an upward trend.

Using the data mentioned above, we created a mock portfolio to determine if adding crypto to one's investment portfolio is a good idea for 2023. Our early findings suggest it's a great time for the addition. From an initial investment of $10,000
(60% S&P 500, 10% Bitcoin, 10% Ethereum, and 20% Cardano), there was an approximate 20% gain ($2,072) by the end of January 2023. While there are more factors to consider, no other factors speak like the actual movement of the market value itself, so we conclude that:

- The crypto market crash from all-time highs in 2021 seems to be over.
- Since market tumbles have slowed and may possibly reverse, now is a great time to add crypto to a portfolio.
- With proper risk management, the potential for crypto gains in 2023 could deliver a boost of approximately 20% - 30% to the client's portfolio.
