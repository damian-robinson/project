## Summary

We begin by analyzing the historical performance data from 2022 into 2023 pulled using the Historical_Data API. Following this, we simulate a portfolio investing $10k at the beginning of the year to verify performance. After we have a sense of market performance, the portfolio is assigned a risk profile that can be checked against our client's risk tolerance. Finally, we analyze current market sentiment and gauge the confidence levels of traders and investors for the crypto and stock markets.
