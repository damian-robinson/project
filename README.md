### First project in FinTech bootcamp.

## Objective

Use Python with various modules, libraries, and APIs to aggregate and analyze crypto and stock performance data from 2022 into 2023 to determine whether or not it's a good time for our client to add crypto to their portfolio.

## Methods

- Technical Analysis
- Risk Classification
- Sentiment Analysis

## Summary

We begin by analyzing the historical performance data from 2022 into 2023 pulled using the [Historic_Crypto API](https://pypi.org/project/Historic-Crypto/). Next, we simulate a portfolio investing $10k at the beginning of 2023 to verify performance. After we have a sense of market performance, the portfolio is assigned a risk profile that can be checked against our client's risk tolerance. Finally, we analyze current market sentiment and gauge confidence levels for the crypto and stock markets.

Moving forward, we would expand with ML, AI, and additional analyses to bring it up to speed with today's advancements.
